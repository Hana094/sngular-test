Sngular Coding Challenge - React Project
Welcome to the Sngular Coding Challenge repository! This project was created as part of a technical assessment for a position at Sngular. The challenge involved solving a mathematical series problem and implementing the solution in a React application.

Problem Statement
The problem required the implementation of a mathematical series defined by the following formula:

serie(n)=2×triangular(n+1)−2×primo(n)+fibonacci(n+1)

Where:

triangular(n): The nth triangular number.

prime(n): The nth prime number.

fibonacci(n): The nth Fibonacci number.

Solution Overview
The solution involves calculating the series for a given input n by implementing the following steps:

Triangular Number Calculation: A function to compute the nth triangular number.

Prime Number Calculation: A function to determine the nth prime number.

Fibonacci Number Calculation: A function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

Series Calculation: Combining the above functions to compute the series as per the given formula.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

JavaScript: The programming language used for logic implementation.

CSS: For styling the application.

Jest: For testing the application.
